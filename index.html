    <h2>Urban Palimpsest</h2>
    <div id = "eIntro">
    <p>"Urban Palimpsest," part of "The Manual for Everyday Life" series, draws inspiration from the dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of urban public works. This installation will explore the concept of emergent art arising from the mundane activities of city maintenance, such as the rearrangement of painted bricks initially marked for practical purposes like signaling bicycle parking or pedestrian paths. Over time, these utilitarian bricks become abstract representations when disturbed and rearranged by workers during routine repairs. This project celebrates this unintended art form, highlighting the fluid boundary between order and chaos, and planned art versus spontaneous creation.</p>
